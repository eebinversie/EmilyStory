Once upon a time there was a boy named Bobby. Bobby was born in Hawaii. He really liked surfing and going fishing with his friends. He owned a pet parrot.

Bobby also owned a pet alligator. One day while Bobby was out surfing and fishing with his friends, the alligator got out of the cage. After going through the kitchen and eating everything in the fridge, the alligator began to get bored, so he went in search of the parrot that he knew Bobby had.

Bobby was the best surfur in the town and everyone watched whenever Bobby in the ocean. After hours of surfing it was getting late and bobby knew it was time to go home. However when Bobby came home it was too a destroyed house. Bobby was in a panic becuase at first he thought that he had gotten robbe, but then he saw parrot feathers on the floor leading into the kitchen... 

What Bobby saw sitting on the kitchen floor almost made him slip backwards in fright. There they were: Bobby's pet parrot pirched on top of the aligators head, wearing a miniature ski mask to 'conceal' its identity. Around him, was a fort consisting of mounds of Bobby's now-wrecked belongings. "Pretty bird!" the parrot chirped. "Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird!" the parrot continued. 

The parrot flew up into the air. There was a swarm of chaos. Bobby jumped up trying to catch the parrot and return him to his cage. Whilst in the air, Bobby felt a sharp nip. The alligator was trying to eat Bobby. It was in that moment that Bobby quickly realized that his alligator and parrot had a murderous plot against him. His life was hanging by the threads. He fought a hard battle but could not overcome the invincible jaws of the alligator. "Success!" screeched the parrot. 

The End.
