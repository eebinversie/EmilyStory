Once upon a time there was a boy named Bobby. Bobby was born in Hawaii. He really liked surfing and going fishing with his friends. He owned a pet parrot.

Bobby also owned a pet alligator. One day while Bobby was out surfing and fishing with his friends, the alligator got out of the cage. After going through the kitchen and eating everything in the fridge, the alligator began to get bored, so he went in search of the parrot that he knew Bobby had.
